## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
XGBoost library should be installed which can be done by running "pip install xgboost" command on terminal.
Other than this there should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

Car Booking Apps is a fast growing business in Egypt because it offers more reliable, secured and intelligent transportation options.
The winner in this area will be the one who employ data analytics to provide better customer service with minimal cost.

In this project I will answer some questions that shall help in providing better service and increase efficiency and revenue:
1. What are the top pick up locations per specific time?
2. What are the top pick up locations per specific times and favorite drop off list?
3. Predict fare amount?
4. Suggest best time to for a specific trip.


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

I have added 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  it should be easy to navigate through the notebook from loading the dataset till answering the above questions one by one.
I have also added comments and markdown cells to make it easier to navigate and understand the file.  


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found in the "Blog-HouseSalesAnalysis.md" [here](https://github.com/telayat/House-Sales-Analysis/blob/main/Blog-HouseSalesAnalysis.md) attached to this repo.
